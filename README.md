# Data Science Capstone Project
Capstone project for Data Scientist Nanodegree (Udacity). 

## Description
The project has two major steps: the customer segmentation report and the supervised learning model.

**1. Customer Segmentation Report**

At the beginning of the project I use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

**2. Supervised Learning Model**

I had access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. With the previous analysis, I built a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
